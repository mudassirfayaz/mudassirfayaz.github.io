I recently applied the YOLOv8 model for a plant leaf classification project, leveraging its state-of-the-art object detection capabilities. This approach enabled highly accurate classification of plant species by analyzing leaf characteristics. The results were promising and demonstrated the power of advanced machine learning models in agricultural and environmental applications. Excited to explore more opportunities in AI-driven solutions for sustainable development!

A normal person cannot know about the health effects of a food/beverage by just looking at the nutrition information written on the product. It needs knowledge about nutrition insights. So this is the very big problem being faced by today’s generation. Most people are using packed food without knowing its effects on their health. Actually, the health effects of these products are written on the product, but in a complex way. Every packed food or beverage contains its ingredients and nutrition information. The solution to this problem is to create an application in which the user will input the nutrition label, and the output of the application will be the effect of that product on our health.
